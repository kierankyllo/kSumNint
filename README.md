# kSumNint
## Implements a backtracking algorithm to solve the k-sum n-integer problem

This program demonstrates the implementation and operation of a backtracking algorithm to solve the 
k-sum n-integer solution problem below:

“Given an equation x1 +x2 +· · ·+xn = k, where k is a constant, and x1, x2, . . . , xn are nonnegative 
integers (which are considered as variables in the equation), list all the solutions. Write a C++ 
pro gram to solve this problem. The input is a pair of integers (n, k) with k ≥ n ≥ 2. The output is 
a list of all the solutions.”

Inputs:

- Input integer n to define number of variables
- Input integer k to define the summed variable solutions
- Input string filename to define output filename

Outputs:

The program produces graphical terminal output as well as txt file output with the given name 
containing the solutions.
